## Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This project aims to provide implementations of various AI algorithms and techniques, along with comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Features

- Implementations of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, clustering).
- Deep learning models using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation.
- Computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed explanations and visualizations.
- Pre-trained models and datasets for experimentation.
